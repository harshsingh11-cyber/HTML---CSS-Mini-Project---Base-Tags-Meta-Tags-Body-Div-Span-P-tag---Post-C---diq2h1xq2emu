                A motorcycle, often called a motorbike, bike, cycle, or trike, is a two- or
                three-wheeled motor vehicle. Motorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of different purposes:
                long-distance travel, commuting, cruising, sport, and off-road riding.

                        A cruiser motorcycle is a motorcycle in the style of American machines from the 1930s to the
                        early 1960s, including those made by Harley-Davidson, Indian, Excelsior and Henderson. The
                        riding position usually places the feet forward and the hands up, with the spine erect or
                        leaning back slightly.

                        stretched-out appearance. They can be built from an original motorcycle which is modified or

                        bike. They can allow you to get around the city and are pretty useful in areas with non highway
